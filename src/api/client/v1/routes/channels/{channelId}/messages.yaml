    summary: Retrieve persisted messages published on channel.
    description: |
      Look up persisted messages of channel. The total amount of messages stored depends
      on channel settings (`featues.persistence.enabled` and `featues.persistence.duration`).

      Messages are sorted from newer to older so newer ones will be returned before older ones.
      Setting the `to` parameter to a past time will result in a stable result set.

      This resource is accessible in admin scope without restircitons. With user scope a
      subscription covering the channel and read permissions are required.
